0.25  Tue, 19 May 2020 23:40:26 GMT

      What happened to version v0.21 to v0.24?

      The version of the embeded XML::Sig was higher that that of Net::SAML2
      which causes some issues in packaging so this release simply skipped the
      versions 0.21 to 0.24.  Not much else to say

      Minor changes for the most part but a requested release based on the
      removal of XML::Cannonical.  In fact that could be the only functionality
      change present.
